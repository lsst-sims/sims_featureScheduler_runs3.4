**Simulate BBH ToOs**



**Definition**:

**N_O** = N Observable Triggers is the number of expected number of O5 all-sky events that will meet the selection cuts established in [https://lssttooworkshop.github.io/images/Rubin_2024_ToO_workshop_final_report.pdf](https://lssttooworkshop.github.io/images/Rubin_2024_ToO_workshop_final_report.pdf) and that are in the visible LSST sky.

**N_t** = N Triggers is the number of all-sky alerts (produced by LKV or any other discovery survey) that meet our selection cuts, regardless of visibility

**Night 0**: the first night after the trigger when the sky location is observable and our follow-up starts. _NOTE_: we should start with night 0 follow up as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours from the time of the LKV alert (could be same as night _of_ trigger)

**t0**: the time when the trigger is received by Rubin

**Tw**: observability window: the time from the trigger to the end of visibility of a field in the area 


**SCHEMA**: 

1) simulate N_t = 3xN_O

2) follow up the visible fraction of the localization area, regardless of trigger location

3) simulate 
- 1 run with N=1/2 x N_t (downscope)
- 1 run with N=3/4 x N_t (downscope)
- 1 run with N=N_t
- 1 run with N=3/2 x N_t (upscope)
- 1 run with N=2 x N_t (upscope)
- 1 run with N_t with 30sec exposures (e.g. where 120sec exposures are asked simulate 4x30s) _NOTE_ : n this run should use the same triggers as the N=N_ run so that we can measure the impact of exposure length aside from other stochastic changes

**SCHEMA (different from earlier simulations)**:

**N_t = 22** triggers simulated

All after June 2027 and before January 2030 simulate trigger time at random over 24h.

Case A) N_t=9 with 10 sq deg area -> yields N_O=3 

Case B) N_t=6  with 20 sq deg area -> yields N_O=2 

Case C) N_t=6  with 30 sq deg area -> yields N_O=2 

_Expected Yield N_O=7_

**A/B/C** (7)
